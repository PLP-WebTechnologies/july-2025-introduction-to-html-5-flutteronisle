<h1>Testimonials </h1>
<p>Angel is not only an excellent executive assistant, managing my research academic and business accounts, but she is also a brilliant independent mind in her own right-often suggesting solutions to research and business puzzles that I faced on a daily basis. She is true asset to any executive that is seeking a talent capable of juggling the impossible, and is incredibly proficient in any task prescribed to her. Moreover, I personally witnessed Angel’s ability to take on new tasks and master novel skills in order to succeed as a top level executive assistant- to an Ivy League research, physician and start up founder. Any individual seeking professional level talent will not be disappointed if they chose to employ Angel in an executive assistant role; she is overqualified.
</p>                                          - Caroline W( Orthopaedic Surgeoon)
<p>My family engaged Angel as our personal assistant to manage our calendars, conduct internet research, and overall help us keep things in order. She was extremely nice to speak with, asked questions when she didn't understand instructions and did most of the work well and on time. She will be great for a family or company which has systems in place.
Angel completed a web research and data entry task with 100% success rate. Angel is very attentive to detail, followed instructions perfectly, and asked intelligent questions. She was also extremely pleasant to work with, and possesses outstanding customer service skills. We will most definitely be working with Angel again, and we would recommend her to anyone! Excellent work!

<p>Highly recommended. I will definitely be using her services again and could not write a more glowing review. Ms. Rapemo is friendly, a great communicator and supplies top quality work.

<p>Angel is fantastic. She anticipates your needs, asks the right questions, and gets the job done quickly and professionally. We are looking forward to hiring her for more.
